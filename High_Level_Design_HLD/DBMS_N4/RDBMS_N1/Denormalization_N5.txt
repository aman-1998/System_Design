# Denormalization :
====================

Why do need Normalization ?
-----------------------------
1. We do normalization to avoid or reduce storing redundant data in table. So, this
   saves storage space.
2. To avoid 'insert' anomllies (To learn about this see RBR video)
3. To avoid 'update' anomallies (To learn about this see RBR video)
4. To avoid 'delete' anomallies (To learn about this see RBR video)


The main goal of Normalization is to reduce storage space. However, nowadays we have
enough storage space. We need fast and highly responsive applications.

Because of Normalization, we may have to join multiple tables to get the required
result. But joining is expensive and time taking.

Denormalization refers to even if a table have redundant data, we will not normalize
the table as we want queries to be executed fast.

Now, in real life, when a database is designed the architect take careful decision 
whether to normalize or denormalize the table. The entire database modeling is a
combination of normalized and denormalized tables.
