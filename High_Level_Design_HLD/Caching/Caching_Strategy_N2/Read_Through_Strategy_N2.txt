==========================
# Read Through Strategy :
==========================
-> Application first checks the cache.
-> If data is found in cache, it is called cache-hit and data is returned to the client.
-> If data is not found in cache, it is called cache-miss. Cache library itself fetch
   the data from DB, store it back to Cache and data is returned to the application.
   
# Pros:
--------
-> Good approach for heavy read applications
-> Logic of fetching data from DB and updating cache is separated from App server.

# Cons :
---------
-> For new data read, there will always be cache-miss. To resolve this we can 
   pre-heat the cache.
-> Cache document datastructure should be same as data present in DB.
-> If appropriate caching staretegy is not used during write operations, there is 
   a chance of inconsistency between cache and DB. For example, if a write operations
   updates or delete the data in DB but cache still hold the same data then which is 
   now stale. Reading stale data is called dirty-read.
