==========================
# Write Around Strategy :
==========================
-> Directly write data into DB
-> It invalidates the data in the cache if found

# Pros :
---------
-> Good approach for heavy read applications if used in combination with either
   cache-aside or read-through strategy.
-> Resolves inconsistency problem between cache and DB.


# Cons :
---------
-> For new data read, there will always be cache-miss. To resolve this we can 
   pre-heat the cache.
-> If DB is down, write operations will fail.
