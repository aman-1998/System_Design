=========================
# Cache Aside Strategy :
=========================
-> Application first checks the cache.
-> If data is found in cache, it is called cache-hit and data is returned to the client.
-> If data is not found in cache, it is called cache-miss. Server app fetches the data
   from DB stores it in cache and then data is returned to the client.

# Pros:
--------
-> Good approach for heavy read applications
-> Even if cache is down, request will not fail, as data will be fetched from DB.
-> Cache document datastructure can be different from the data present in DB.

# Cons:
--------
-> For new data read, there will always be cache-miss. To resolve this we can 
   pre-heat the cache
-> If appropriate caching staretegy is not used during write operations, there is 
   a chance of inconsistency between cache and DB. For example, if a write operations
   updates or delete the data in DB but cache still hold the same data which is 
   now stale. Reading stale data is called dirty-read.
