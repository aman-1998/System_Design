===========================
# Write Through Strategy :
===========================
-> First writes data into cache.
-> Then synchronously writes data into DB

# Pros:
--------
-> Very good for read heavy applications as chances of cache-hit increases a lot.
   There is no need to pre-heat the cache. It is used in combination with either
   cache-aside or read-through strategy.
-> Cache and DB always remains consistent.

# Cons :
---------
-> Latency increases as 2-phase commit is required (first cache and then DB). If any
   one fails entire transaction is rolled back.
-> If DB is down, write operations will fail.
