# FTP (File Transfer Protocol):
--------------------------------

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used to transfer 
files between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network (like the Internet).

It allows users to upload, download, delete, rename, move, or copy files on a 
remote server.

FTP works over TCP.

FTP typically uses two separate connections:
-> Control Connection: One for control commands (like login, change directory).
-> Data Connection: One for data transfer (actual file content).

For example: 
1. In windows winSCP is used to connect to remote server. And file transfers
   take place between local and remote server.
2. Web Hosting : Web developers often use FTP to upload website files 
   (HTML, CSS, images, scripts) from their local computer to a web server. 
   Many web hosting providers support FTP access so you can manage your website 
   content easily.


1. Control Connection :
------------------------
This connection is used for sending commands and receiving responses between the 
client and server.

Example: ls, pwd, cd, chmod, etc

Note: It stays open for the entire FTP session until the client logs out

Data flow:
Commands flow from client to server, and responses flow back from server to client 
on this connection.


2. Data Connection :
---------------------
This connection is used for transferring the actual file data.

Example: File contents when uploading or downloading a file.

Note: This connection is opened and closed for each data transfer

Data flow:
Data can flow from client to server ot viceversa.


Why Two Connections?
---------------------
-> Having separate control and data connections allows the client and server to 
   send commands and transfer data independently and simultaneously.
-> This separation is useful because control commands (like changing directories) do 
   not block or interfere with data transfer.
   
   
There are various secured versions of FTP:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
| Protocol | Description                  | Security                 |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| FTP      | Basic file transfer protocol | No encryption (insecure) |
| SFTP     | File transfer over SSH       | Encrypted (secure)       |
| FTPS     | FTP over SSL/TLS             | Encrypted (secure)       |
| SCP      | Secure copy over SSH         | Encrypted (secure)       |
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
# FTPS Protocol:
------------------
Just like HTTPS = HTTP + TLS handshake

Similarly, FTPS = FTP + TLS handshake.

TLS handshake concept is same.
