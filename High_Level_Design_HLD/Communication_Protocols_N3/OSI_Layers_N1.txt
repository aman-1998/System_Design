# Communication:
-----------------
Communication is nothing but interaction between two systems to solve a common problem.

The entire journey of a message travelling from source to destination is categorized 
into 7 layers. This is also called OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection) model
OSI is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication 
or computing system into seven distinct layers. Each layer has a specific role in 
handling network communication.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Layer Number | Layer Name       | Function Summary                                                          | Example Protocols / Technologies           |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 7        	   | Application      | Provides network services to applications                                 | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, REST, SOAP           |
| 6        	   | Presentation     | Translates data format, encryption, compression                           | SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII, encryption protocols |
| 5        	   | Session          | Manages sessions, Authentication and Authorization                        | NetBIOS, PPTP, SAP, session checkpointing  |
| 4        	   | Transport        | Provides reliable or unreliable data transfer                             | TCP (reliable), UDP (unreliable)           |
| 3        	   | Network          | Handles routing and forwarding of data                                    | IP, ICMP, OSPF, BGP                        |
| 2        	   | Data Link        | Transfers data between adjacent network nodes, error detection/correction | Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), PPP              |
| 1        	   | Physical         | Transmits raw bitstream over physical medium                              | Cables, switches, hubs, electrical signals |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Physical Layer (Layer 1) :
---------------------------
Deals with the physical connection between devices.
Transmits raw bits (0s and 1s) over a medium (cables, Wi-Fi, fiber optics).
Defines voltage levels, pin layouts, cabling, and data rates.
Examples: Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth, HDMI.

Data Link Layer (Layer 2) :
----------------------------
Provides node-to-node communication (e.g., between two directly connected devices).
Handles error detection and correction (CRC checks).
Manages MAC addresses for hardware identification.
Divides data into frames.
Examples: Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), PPP, switches.

Network Layer (Layer 3) :
--------------------------
Responsible for logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing packets across networks.
Determines the best path for data transfer (routing protocols like OSPF, BGP).
Fragments large packets if needed.
Examples: IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, routers.

Transport Layer (Layer 4) :
----------------------------
Ensures end-to-end communication with reliability (TCP) or speed (UDP).
Segments data into smaller units.
Manages flow control and error recovery (retransmission in TCP).
Examples: TCP (reliable), UDP (unreliable), SCTP.

Session Layer (Layer 5) :
--------------------------
Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions between applications.
Handles authentication, reconnection, and session checkpoints.
Examples: NetBIOS, RPC, SIP.

Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
-----------------------------
Translates data into a format the application can understand (encryption, compression, encoding).
Converts between different formats (e.g., JSON, XML, ASCII, JPEG).
Handles SSL/TLS encryption.

Application Layer (Layer 7) :
------------------------------
The user interface for network services.
Provides network services directly to applications (HTTP, FTP, SMTP).
Examples: HTTP (web), SMTP (email), FTP (file transfer), DNS (domain names), SSH.


Data's journey starts from Application layer and ends in Physical layer.


OSI Model Layers with Real-World Analogies:
--------------------------------------------
7. Application Layer
----------------------
Analogy: You (the user) interacting with an app or website.
This layer is like the receptionist or the user interface that you directly interact with.
It understands your request — like “I want to browse a webpage” or “send an email.”
Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc.

6. Presentation Layer
-----------------------
Analogy: The translator or interpreter.
Translates your request into a format the other side understands.
Converts data formats (e.g., text encoding), encrypts or decrypts messages, compresses or decompresses data.
Like when you speak English but the other side understands French, so this layer translates.

5. Session Layer
------------------
Analogy: The meeting organizer or moderator.
Sets up, manages, and tears down sessions (conversations) between computers.
Keeps track of whose turn it is to speak, manages dialogue control.
Imagine a conference call host who manages when each person talks and keeps the session active.

4. Transport Layer
-------------------
Analogy: The reliable courier or delivery service.
Breaks down large messages into smaller packets, ensures they arrive intact and in order.
Manages retransmissions if packets are lost or corrupted.
Like a courier who tracks packages, confirms delivery, and re-sends lost parcels.

3. Network Layer
-----------------
Analogy: The GPS or postal routing office.
Determines the best path for data to travel across multiple networks to reach the destination.
Handles logical addressing (IP addresses).
Like the post office routing your mail through cities and sorting centers until it reaches the recipient.

2. Data Link Layer
-------------------
Analogy: The local mail carrier or building mailroom.
Responsible for sending packets between neighboring devices on the same network.
Handles physical addressing (MAC addresses), error detection, and framing.
Like the mail carrier who delivers mail from the post office to your home or office.

1. Physical Layer
------------------
Analogy: The physical roads, cables, and postal trucks.
Transmits raw bits (0s and 1s) over physical media (cables, fiber optics, wireless signals).
Defines electrical/optical/radio signals, voltage levels, connectors, etc.
Like the roads and vehicles that physically carry the mail or packages.

Summary with Analogy Flow
You (Application) → Translator (Presentation) → Meeting Organizer (Session) → Courier (Transport) → GPS/Post Office (Network) → Local Mail Carrier (Data Link) → Roads & Trucks (Physical)
