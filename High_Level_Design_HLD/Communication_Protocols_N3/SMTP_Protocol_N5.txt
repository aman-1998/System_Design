# SMTP Protocol :
------------------
SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.

It is the standard protocol used to send emails over the Internet.

SMTP is responsible for sending, routing, and delivering email messages from a 
sender’s email client to the recipient’s email server.

How SMTP works:
----------------
When you click Send in your email client (like Outlook, Gmail, Thunderbird), 
the email client connects to an SMTP server.

The SMTP server takes your email and routes it across the internet to the 
recipient’s mail server.

The recipient’s mail server uses other protocols (like POP3 or IMAP) to 
let the recipient retrieve their email.


Key points:
------------
-> SMTP works on TCP
-> SMTP works with TLS to secure the connection and email delivery.
-> SMTP is only for sending mail — it doesn’t handle receiving or reading emails.
-> SMTP servers communicate with each other to transfer email messages between domains.


Note: Just like HTTPS, in SMTP also TLS handshake takes place before sendig mail.


Example:
---------
When you send an email to friend@example.com, your mail client uses SMTP to 
send it to your outgoing mail server.

Your SMTP server then finds the recipient’s mail server (through DNS MX records) 
and forwards the email.

The recipient’s server stores it until they retrieve it with IMAP or POP3.


# IMAP Protocol:
-----------------
-> Your email client talks to the mail server to list, read, and organize emails.
-> Emails stay on the server.
-> When you read or delete an email, the change is reflected on the server and seen on all your devices.

# POP3 Protocol:
-----------------
-> Your email client downloads emails from the server to your device.
-> By default, emails are deleted from the server after download (can be configured to leave copies).
-> Email stays local to that device and changes aren’t synced back.

Usage:
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Protocol | Best For                                                             |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IMAP** | Accessing email from multiple devices and keeping everything in sync |
| **POP3** | Downloading emails to a single device and managing them locally      |

Difference IMAP vs POP3 :
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Feature                     | IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)                                       | POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3)                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**                 | Manage and sync emails directly on server                                     | Download emails from server to local device          |
| **Email storage**           | Emails stay on the mail server                                                | Emails are downloaded & usually deleted from server  |
| **Multiple device support** | Excellent (syncs emails, folders, read/unread status across devices)          | Poor (emails downloaded on one device only, no sync) |
| **Access offline**          | Limited offline access (emails remain on server)                              | Full offline access (emails are local)               |
| **Folder support**          | Supports multiple folders (Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc.)                         | Usually only Inbox is supported                      |
| **Email status sync**       | Syncs read/unread, flagged status across devices                              | No status sync; downloaded emails lose server flags  |
| **Use case**                | Modern usage for accessing email from multiple devices (mobile, desktop, web) | Simple, single-device usage or low storage needs     |
